Run the following code to install it:\r\n!pip install python-igraph\r\n!pip install pandas\r\n!pip install pycairo\r\n!pip install cairocffi\r\n\r\n# Then, load the package using the import statement:\r\nimport igraph as ig\r\n\r\n# Step 2: Import the edgelist data Assuming you have an edgelist CSV file with columns 'source' and 'target' representing retweet connections, you can import it using the read() function from the pandas library:\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\n# mount Drive (if in Colabs or load from local disk or GitHub)\r\nfrom google.colab import drive\r\ndrive.mount('/content/drive')\r\n\r\n# Import the edgelist data\r\nedgelist = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Vaccine_edgelist_rtnet.csv')\r\n\r\n\r\n# Step 3: Create a network object Next, create a network object using igraph's Graph() function. You can pass the source and target columns from the edgelist DataFrame as arguments:\r\n# Create a graph from the edgelist data\r\nnetwork = ig.Graph.TupleList(edgelist.itertuples(index=False), directed=True)\r\n\r\n# Step 4: Basic network visualization To visualize the network, use the plot() function:\r\nig.plot(network, bbox=(2000, 2000))\r\n# This will generate a basic plot of the retweet network.\r\n\r\n# Step 5: Analyzing network properties Now, you can analyze various network properties using igraph. Here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n# Degree centrality: Calculate the in-degree centrality (number of retweets received) using the indegree() function:\r\nindegree_centrality = network.indegree()\r\nprint(indegree_centrality)\r\n#plt.plot(indegree_centrality)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Betweenness centrality: Calculate the betweenness centrality using the betweenness() function:\r\nbetweenness_centrality = network.betweenness()\r\nprint(betweenness_centrality)\r\n\r\n# Community detection: Detect communities within the network using edge-betweenness for directed graphs:\r\ncommunity_EB = network.community_edge_betweenness()\r\n\r\nprint(community_EB)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Igraph and other packages provide many more community detection algorithms that you can compare https://igraph.org/python/doc/api/igraph.Graph.html#community_multilevel\r\n\r\n# Step 6: To visualize network properties, you can use different plotting functions. Here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n# Visualizing in-degree centrality\r\nig.plot(network, vertex_size=indegree_centrality, bbox=(4000, 4000))\r\n\r\n# Visualizing betweenness centrality:\r\nig.plot(network, vertex_size=betweenness_centrality, bbox=(4000, 4000))\r\n\r\n# As we can see the network graphs look rather messy but by adjusting the layout, node size and gravity we can make them look nicer.
