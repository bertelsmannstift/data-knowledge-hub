Using the X (Twitter) API as a data source can be extremely valuable for
scientific studies. When it comes to collecting data from X (Twitter), the rules
you define to create your data queries play a critical role. They affect the
quality and relevance of the data you receive.

:::tip Building a query or rule

If you are using the Search Tweets endpoint (Recent Search and Full Search), the filter is called a query. And if you are using the Filtered Stream endpoint, it is called a rule.
:::

## Best Practices for Creating Queries and Rules

Here are some tips and **best practices for creating effective rules** for querying the X (Twitter) API:

1. **Define clear goals**: Before you start querying, know what information you need. Do you want to collect tweets about a specific topic, from a specific location, or at a specific time? The clearer your goals, the more efficient your query will be.

2. **Keyword research**: Take the time to research relevant keywords, phrases, and hashtags. This will help you focus your data request.

3. **Use Boolean Operators**: You can use Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to make your search criteria more specific. For example, climate change AND research returns tweets that contain both terms.

4. **Consider alternate spellings**: When focusing on keywords or hashtags, consider alternate spellings, abbreviations, or misspellings.

5. **Use exclusions**: To filter unwanted results from your query, you can exclude certain words or phrases.

6. **Use geolocation features**: If your research interest is geographically limited, use the X’s (Twitter’s) API geolocation feature to collect tweets from specific regions. (Note: Only a small number of tweets contain geo-information.)

7. **Set time limits**: If relevant, you can limit your query to a specific time period.

8. **Test and tweak**: Start with a broad query and narrow it down incrementally. Review the results and adjust your query as needed.

9. **Consider usage limits**: The X (Twitter) API has usage limits. Make sure you understand them and plan your queries accordingly.

## Building a query or rule

If you are using the Search Tweets endpoint (Recent Search and Full Search), the filter is called a query. And if you are using the Filtered Stream endpoint, it is called a rule.

### Query limitations

Depending on your access level, the length of queries or the number of rules may be limited.

### Operator types: standalone and conjunction-required

Operators are distinguished in two types: standalone operators and conjunction-required operators. Standalone operators need not necessarily be used in conjunction with other operators, but they can be.

The following query utilizes the #hashtag operator, which is a standalone operator.

```
#science
```

Conjunction-required operators presuppose the use of at least one standalone operator in the query. Otherwise, they would be too broad in scope and the query would generate an excessive number of Tweets. **The following examples do not contain standalone operators and thus are not legitimate queries**.

```
has:mentions
has:media OR is:verified
```

If we add in a standalone operator, such as the phrase “twitter data”, the query will work properly. The above example can be made valid by adding a standalone operator. For example:

```
"research results" has:mentions (has:media OR has:links)
```

## Boolean operators and grouping

Multiple keywords can be combined by using boolean operators. Those are short words (e.g. AND, OR) that can be used to either expand the scope of the query or to specify the query.

|                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AND logic           | Queries containing keywords combined by the boolean `AND` logic will yield only Tweets containing all the keywords. Spaces between keywords are implicitly interpreted as `AND` logic. For example, `research results #ScientificBreakthrough` will only match Tweets containing the words _research_ and _results_ as well as the hashtag _#ScientificBreakthrough_.                                                                                                                       |
| OR logic            | Combining keywords with the `OR`-operator expands the scope of the query. It will find every tweet containing at least one of the given keywords. For example, `human OR resources OR #meme` will retrieve all tweets that include at least one of the terms _human_, _resources_ or the hashtag _#meme_.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| NOT logic, negation | To apply negation (`NOT`) in logic, add a hyphen (-) before a keyword or operator. For instance, in the query `science #meme -informatics`, the search will identify posts with both _#meme_ and _science_, excluding those that also have the term _informatics_. A frequently used example is `-is:retweet`, excluding Retweets and allowing matches for original Tweets, Quote Tweets, and replies. While all operators can be negated, standalone negated operators are not functional. |
| Grouping            | Grouping operators is possible with parentheses. For instance, `(research results) OR (#meme has:images)` will yield Tweets that have either the _research_ and _results_ terms, or images tagged with the _#meme_ hashtag. The sequence of evaluation involves ANDs first, then ORs.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

When using both AND and OR functionalities together, the order of operations is as follows:

- Operators that are linked by AND logic are combined as the first step.
- Afterward, operators connected through OR logic are applied.

For example:

- `dog OR cat mouse` will be interpreted as `dog OR (cat mouse)`
- `horse cow OR sheep` will be interpreted as `(horse cow) OR sheep`

To remove any vagueness and ensure accurate evaluation of your rule, use parentheses to group terms together when necessary.

For example:

- `(dog OR cat) mouse`
- `horse (cow OR sheep)`

## Punctuation, diacritics, and case sensitivity

Characters that include accents or diacritics are handled just like regular characters, without being regarded as word separators. For instance, a rule with the keyword `jalapeños` would solely identify Tweets containing the exact term _jalapeños_, without considering matches like _jalape_, _jalapen_, or _os_.

All operators are treated case-insensitive. For example, the query _science_ will provide the same results as _science_, _SCIENCE_, _Science_.

Rules containing accents or diacritics lead to distinct behaviors between the Filtered Stream and Search endpoints.

### Filtered Stream

When you define a keyword or hashtag rule that includes character accents or diacritics, it will identify Tweets containing the precise word with the correct accents or diacritics. It won’t include Tweets with accurate letters but lacking accents or diacritic marks.

For example, rules with the keyword _Résumé_ or hashtag _#jalapeños_ will match Tweets that contain _Résumé_ or _#jalapeños_ because they include the accents or diacritic. These rules will not match Tweets that contain _Resume_ or _#jalapenos_.

### Search Tweets

Unlike Filtered Stream endpoints, Search endpoints are not insensitive to accents and diacritics. This means that queries containing them will return both terms with and without accents or diacritics.
For example, the querys `Résumé` or hashtag `#jalapeños` will yield Tweets containing _Résumé_ or _#jalapeños_ as well as those containing _Resume_ or _#jalapenos_.

For example, the queries _Résumé_ or hashtag _#jalapeños_ will yield Tweets containing Résumé or _#jalapeños_ as well as those containing _Resume_ or _#jalapenos_.

## Quote Tweet matching behavior

### Filtered Stream

Operators will apply to both the content present in the initial Tweet that was quoted and the content present within the Quote Tweet.

### Search Tweets

Operators will **not** find matches in the content of the original Tweet that was quoted, but they will match content present in the Quote Tweet.

## Iteratively building a rule

### Test your rule early and often

Achieving accurate results with a rule on the first attempt is uncommon. Due to the sheer volume and variety of Tweets it is rarely evident which exact Tweets the search will return.

In the process of creating a rule, it is therefore essential to frequently test it using the stream endpoint to observe the data it retrieves. You should also consider testing it using one of the Search Tweet endpoints, provided that the operators you use are also compatible with that endpoint.

In the following we will start with this simple rule and develop it in dependence on the output it generates:

```
create OR creation
```

### Use results to narrow the rule

While testing the rule, it is essential to review the returned Tweets to verify if they contain the anticipated and desired data. It is recommended to start with a broad rule that typically generates a large set of Tweets. Afterwards this rule can be refined to exclude unwanted results.

Since with the existing rule we have obtained tweets in multiple languages the following specification limits the results to Tweets in English.

```
(create OR creation) lang:en
```

The test resulted in several Tweets praising divine creation. We are going to remove them from the results by adding the negated keyword operator _-divine_. Furthermore, we do not want to include retweets. We can reach that goal by adding the negated _-is:retweet_ operator.

```
(create OR creation) lang:en -divine -is:retweet
```

### Adjust for inclusion where needed

If the query does not return certain Tweets that you know exist, you might need to widen your rule by eliminating operators that could potentially lead to the exclusion of the desired data.

We noticed that there are Tweets treating the same topic that are not included in our search results. That is because they use different terms similar or equal meaning. To cover those Tweets, we can add those terms to the rule:

```
(create OR creation OR making OR founding) lang:en -divine -is:retweet
```

### Adjust for popular trends/bursts over the time period

Since X (Twitter) is a highly dynamic platform, your rules may need to be adapted to upcoming and outdated trends. We therefore recommend updating and adjusting your rules periodically.

## Operators

- **Essential**: Available with all access levels.
- **Elevated**: Available when using a Project with Elevated, Academic Research, or Enterprise access.
- Certain operators have an alternate name or alias that can be used.

### Available for Search Tweets and Filtered Stream

| Operator                | Type                 | Availability | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `keyword`               | Standalone           | Essential    | Matches a keyword within the body of a Tweet. This is a tokenized match, meaning that your keyword string will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body. Tokenization splits words based on punctuation, symbols, and Unicode basic plane separator characters.<br /><br />For example, a Tweet with the text “I like coca-cola” would be split into the following tokens: I, like, coca, cola. These tokens would then be compared to the keyword string used in your query. To match strings containing punctuation (for example coca-cola), symbol, or separator characters, you must wrap your keyword in double-quotes.<br /><br />Example: `pepsi OR cola OR "coca cola"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `emoji`                 | Standalone           | Essential    | Matches an emoji within the body of a Tweet. Similar to a keyword, emojis are a tokenized match, meaning that your emoji will be matched against the tokenized text of the Tweet body.<br /><br />Note that if an emoji has a variant, you must wrap it in double quotes to add to a query.<br /><br />Example: `(😃 OR 😡) 😬`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `url:`                  | Standalone           | Essential    | Performs a tokenized match on any validly-formatted URL of a Tweet.<br /><br />This operator can matches on the contents of both the `url` or `expanded_url` fields. For example, a Tweet containing "You should check out Twitter Developer Labs: https://t.co/c0A36SWil4" (with the short URL redirecting to https://developer.twitter.com) will match both the following rules:<br /><br />`from:TwitterDev url:"https://developer.twitter.com"`<br />(because it will match the contents of `entities.urls.expanded_url`)<br /><br />`from:TwitterDev url:"https://t.co"`<br />(because it will match the contents of `entities.urls.url`)<br /><br />Tokens and phrases containing punctuation or special characters should be double-quoted (for example, `url:"/developer"`). Similarly, to match on a specific protocol, enclose in double-quotes (for example, `url:"https://developer.twitter.com"`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
