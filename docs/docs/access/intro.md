# Introduction to researching and monitoring online discourse

To help you get started and better navigate the research landscape of social media monitoring (SMM) and researching online discourse more broadly, weâ€™ve collected a first set of chapters that aim to provide orientation and guidance to researchers and practitioners exploring various options and dimensions of social media monitoring. We welcome additional content and have added a selection of chapters below that would make for great contributions.

**[How and When to Access Data for Social Media Monitoring](access)**: This chapter provides an introduction to accessing data for social media monitoring through the lens of platform regulations and policies. 

:::info Open for contributions

We welcome contributions on a rolling basis. At the moment, we particularly welcome chapters dealing with the following questions 

- How to deal with "dark socials"?
- Data access rights beyond the European Union and the U.S.
